## Pajamas

Pajamas is ~~almost~~ an e-commerce app built using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/). I didn't actually connected it to a payment API, but some of it's features are:
 - Posts read from disk and compile into static pages (next js magic);
 - A cart working cart system;
 - A nice carousel (I'm proud of this one);
 - Nice and responsive design, not very beautifull, but it does work;

# Code
I tried to take the functional approach as much as possible with this project, and it ended up really nice. Turns out the functional paradigm is very fun to write code in.

# Run it yourself!
`git clone` it somewhere, `cd` into the folder and run either `npm run build && npm run start` for a production build, or `npm run dev` for a development build and you're done!

Anyway, feel free to do whatever you want with the ~~not very good~~ code.
